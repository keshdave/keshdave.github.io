title: About Me
subtitle: Keshavi Dave - B.S. Statistics & M.S. Data Science
---

I am a current data science grad student at Michigan State University coming off of a B.S. in Statistics from Western Michigan University; along with three minors: business analytics, computer science, and mathematics. I love working where analytical thinking meets creativity, especially when it comes to making complex data feel intuitive, useful, and a little bit fun.

My academic and project experiences span research, teaching, and applied analytics. As a **Geology Research Assistant**, I built a detailed data atlas of the Southern Niagaran Pinnacle Reef Trend, diving into R-based statistical analysis and visualization. I also spent my time as an undergrad as a **Course Assistant & Supplemental Instructor**, tutoring and supporting students in math, programming, and statistics. All work that has sharpened my communication skills and my ability to break down tough concepts into something approachable.

As a **Sousaphone Drill Instructor** for the Bronco Marching Band- comprised of over 400 sudents, I trained new members, kept rehearsals running smoothly, and helped maintain a collaborative, positive culture under pressure. Those seasons taught me a lot about teamwork, clarity, and resilience; all qualities I bring to every data project I take on.

Since my undergrad I've been excited about **sports analytics**, especially with hockey. As a part of MSU’s Sports Analytics Club and their Hockey R&D team, I get to combine my love of the game with my interest in modeling and data-driven story telling. You can find me sitting in Munn Arena with my fellow club-mates logging shots and other statistics in real time. I also aim to be apart of the Baseball R&D team this spring, broadning my sports analysis horizons to Americas favorite pastime!

I’m someone who loves learning, building, and exploring new ways to solve problems, especially though code, research, or a fresh data visualization. If you want to collaborate, talk analytics, or geek out over hockey stats, I’m always up for it.
